            <p>Starting from scratch can be intimidating, but it's essential to embrace curiosity. Understand that everyone starts somewhere, and curiosity is the key to unlocking new knowledge.
                Hands-On Practice:

Theory is crucial, but hands-on practice is equally important. Work on small projects to apply what you've learned. This practical experience will enhance your understanding and build confidence.
